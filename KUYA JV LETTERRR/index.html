                  <p>Hi Kuya!</p>
                   <p>I really don't know where to start, but thank you so much for everything you've done for our community!
                    <br> <br>
                    I was so scared gud dati when I was told na mag sama sama na ako with you guyss kay like i don't know saan ilugar yung sarili ko. That is why Kuya, I'm so grateful jud sayo kay you were one of the Kuyas here in the community that made me feel as if I'm in the right place. You were able to make me feel welcomed and appreciated. You never made me feel na di ko kaya and di ko capable of doing what I must do. Your words and reassurance really helped me go out of my comfort zone, so thank you Kuya. You are indeed a blessing to this community. 
                    <br> <br>
                    I know di pa ganun katagal yung pinagsamahan natin pero thank you for the genuine friendship and for being a Kuya not only to me, but to everyone here in YFC. 
                    <br> <br>
                    This PLR indeed taught me and reminded me about my duties and responsibilities here in our community. So thank you so much for again being an instrument and bringing us closer to God. 
                    <br> <br>
                    Padayon sa pag serbisyo Kuya! I will pray for you! Lovelots!
